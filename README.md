# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

***

## Brief Description of the Problem and Data (5 pts)

The challenge is to **detect whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not**. This task is crucial in disaster response management, as accurately identifying relevant information can significantly enhance crisis response efforts. To tackle this challenge, a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model will be employed due to its effectiveness in text analysis and understanding.

The data is sourced from the [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data), which **includes both training and test sets**. The training set comprises **7,613 tweets**, each labeled as disaster ('1') or non-disaster ('0'). These tweets are presented in plain text format and represent a wide range of contexts and wording variations. The test set consists of unlabeled tweets that will be used to evaluate the model's performance.
